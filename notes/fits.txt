sy20151007mapJay0002
    - binary: true
    - conditions: high/low contrast + coarse grid
    - latency: 0.09
    - trials: 4997
    - free params: 144
    - good-fits: 16/96
        - max score: cell 50 rsq=0.17
        - RF is single pixel (since grid is so large?)
    - good-fits-hCont: 15/96
        - max score: cell 50 rsq=0.27
        - this trend holds for all 15 cells, that the hCont score is better
    - good-fits-lCont: 3/96
        - max score: cell 29 rsq=0.04

SY20151029JayMovie0001
    - binary: true
    - conditions: high/low contrast + fine grid
    - latency: 0.10
    - trials: 4000
    - free params: 1024
    - good-fits: 0/96
    - good-fits-grid: 8/96
        - all good fits were in first quadrant
        - cells: [22 24 27 29 43 59 62 65]
        - cell 59 rsq=0.07
            - RF takes up 1 pixel, maybe some spread to immediately adjacent pixels
    - good-fits-grid-hCont: 2/96
        - cells: [24 59]
        - rsq=0.05, 0.09 respectively
            - cell 24 RF has 4 pixels--2 black on top of 2 white

SY20151030JayMovie0002
    - binary: false
    - conditions: gauss + fine grid (n.b. called "coarse" erroneously)
    - latency: 0.088
    - trials: 8000
    - free params: 1024
    - good-fits: 0/96

    - binary: true
    - conditions: high/low contrast + fine grid
    - latency: 0.10
    - trials: 5508
    - free params: 1024
    - good-fits: 1/96
        - cell 41 rsq=0.2853; RF is totally uninterpretable
    - good-fits-grid: 3/96
        - grid1: [24 59 62], highest score is 59 with rsq=0.03
    - good-fits-grid1-hCont: 3/96
        - grid1: [12 24 59], highest score is 59 with rsq=0.11
        - RFs are as on SY20151029JayMovie0001 but 59 maybe a bit bigger
    - good-fits-grid(8x8)-hCont: 15/96
        - grid1, grid6 have the most; most in grid1
        - cells 12, 24 do better here with 8x8; cell 59 does the same as with 16x16
        - RFs are just one or two pixels    
    - good-fits-grid(8x8)-hCont: 15/96
        - only one grid, with starts=[4 4], nd=8
    - good-fits-grid(8x8)-lCont: 5/96
        - cells: [13 18 29 30 62]
        - highest score is 18 with rsq=0.02
        - RFs are just one or two pixels

SY20151112JayMovie0001
    - binary: false
    - conditions: ICA
    - latency: 0.088
    - trials: 7828
    - free params: 256
    - good-fits: 1/96
        - cell 95 rsq=0.05; RF is broad and Gaussian-looking
        - n.b. I loaded 'ICA_16.mat' instead of using 'ica_mov' field; regressed on X*pinv(A'); not sure how this will affect fits...should probably try out the 'ica_mov' values
    - good-fits-ica_mov: 1/96
        - cell 95 rsq=0.05; RF is broad and ellipse or cloud-like
        - tried Ridge and ARD
        - n.b. tried suggested latency of 0.0 and NO fits were good
